            <h6>My Story:</h6>
            <p>Like many, I graduated college, not sure if I had chosen the right major. I couldn't find a job that paid a decent salary although I two degrees and many years experience working with children. I began teaching technology and fell in love with what I was teaching. I enjoyed empowering students to create new things using technology. While participating in the Hour of Code, I began to develop a love for web development and  took some time to teach myself front end technology. Due to a lack of job security, I explored careers in technology and realized that there is so much out there to learn. I enrolled in V School's program for career changers. A full-time 12-week full stack development course. There I learned the MEAN/MERN stack from highly skilled instructors. This prepared me for competing in a competitive and thriving market of web development.</p>
